# house_price_prediction
House Price Prediction Using Linear and Polynomial Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict house prices based on several features such as house size, the number of bedrooms, and the age of the house using Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.
Project Overview

We use a dataset containing information about houses, including:

    House Size (sq ft)
    Number of Bedrooms
    House Age (years)
    House Price ($1000)

The project uses Linear Regression to model the relationship between house price and the features. It then applies Polynomial Regression to improve the accuracy of the predictions by considering non-linear relationships.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Libraries:
        numpy
        pandas
        scikit-learn
        matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

How to Run the Project

    Clone the repository or download the code.
    Open the project folder in your IDE or terminal.
    Run the Python file house_price_prediction.py:

python house_price_prediction.py

The model will split the dataset into training and testing sets, train both linear and polynomial regression models, and display the results in a plot comparing the actual prices to the predicted prices.
Results

    The accuracy of the Linear Regression model is displayed.
    The accuracy of the Polynomial Regression model is displayed.
    The plot will show the comparison between actual house prices and predicted prices for both models.
